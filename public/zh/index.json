你是否因为电脑损害而弄丢过实验数据？明明是线上实验，但数据却不能上传云端？或者你也是OpenScience的拥趸(检索该公众号试试)，想把自己的实验数据放到开放平台 OSF，做出自己的贡献?\n没错，就在今天，这一切可以轻松的完成。今天我要隆重的给大家介绍一个非常好用的数据收集工具——DataPipe。\nDataPipe 是一个开放平台，提供REST API接口，可以让你在任何实验程序上把实验数据上传到OSF(Open Science Framework)。\n如果你不知什么是 REST API。没关系，你就当他是一个网站，当你访问他，你就可以上传数据，只不过这一切可以用一行简单的代码实现。\n如果你不知道 OSF。没关系，你就当他是 github 或者一个云盘，可以用来存储你的代码和实验数据等。\nDataPipe 已经集成到实验编程工具 jsPsych 当中，你可以很方便的在 jsPsych 调用 DataPipe 的API。\n如果你不了解 jsPsych，可以理解为他是类似于 E-prime, psychtoolbox(Matlab), psychopy(Python), OpenSesame的实验编程工具。\n此外，它可以方便的用于在线实验，或在线问卷数据的收集。类似于 Qualtrics, Credamo等。\n你可以点击连接 jsPsych 进行了解。它使用前端代码 html + js 来实现实验程序的编程。\n让我们回到正题，今天我将以 jspsych 和 psychopy 为例，演示如何使用DataPipe来收集数据，并把数据上传到 osf中。\n后面涉及到的测试材料在这里 https://gitee.com/epool/data-pipe_primer 大家可以自行体验和设置。\n前提准备 在 jspsych 和 psychopy 进行加入 DataPipe 功能前，你需要做如下配置：注册 osf 账号，在 osf 中创建项目；在 DataPipe 中创建项目，连接 osf 的项目，进行一些基本配置。跟着我的步伐，5分钟完成配置。\n创建OSF项目 如果你还没有 osf 账号，请 https://osf.io/ 登陆官网进行简单的注册。\n然后，为了给 DataPipe 的访问权限，我们需要生成密钥(token)。\n最后，在OSF主页点击“Create Project”就可以创建项目了。注意，你需要复制项目的编号，在下图中。\n在DataPipe上创建实验 完成 OSF 的配置后，我们需要对 DataPipe进行配置。\n首先，进入 https://pipe.jspsych.org/。 进行注册和登陆。\n之后，将之前 osf 的密钥(token)配置到 DataPipe 中。\n最后，创建项目（实验），Done。\n这样你就进入了这个实验的控制面板,可以设置一些实验参数了。有些功能我们暂时用不到，就先不介绍了。\n注意，请一定要复制实验ID备用。\n在实验中集成DataPipe 为了能够将数据发送到DataPipe,你需要在实验代码中调用DataPipe的API。如果你在使用jsPsych来编写实验,可以直接使用jsPsychPipe插件调用DataPipe。如果不使用jsPsych,也可以直接通过fetch API调用DataPipe。\n在DataPipe的实验页面,已经提供了不同语言调用DataPipe API的代码示例。选择适合你的语言,根据页面上的指引就可以轻松地在实验中集成DataPipe了。\n在 jspsych 中进行设置 具体代码见 jspsych_exp_test.html。 大家可以下载该模板自行进行更改。\n这里指针对关键代码进行解释。\nfilename 为上传的文件名称。\nexperiment_id 为 DataPipe 配置中的 ID。这个非常关键，确保填写正确。\n大家可以进入 http://epool.gitee.io/data-pipe_primer/jspsych_exp_test.html 进行测试。在本地运行也是相同的，点击下一页就会上传数据。\n上传的数据如下，名称为之前设置的 filename\n在 psychopy 中进行设置 打开psychopy，我们以自带的 stroop 实验为例。(注意，我是用的psychopy版本为 2023.2.2)\n然后，添加 code 模块。并进行相应的设置，也就是最关键的，实验ID，文件名和数据。\n在 python 中可以通过 thisExp.getJSON() 获取数据。 这里将数据保存为 json，你也可以自行转化为 csv。注意，在我自己的测试中，python 代码会遇到 SSL 错误。所以我使用 js 的实现方式，见下方。\n在 js code 中，可以通过 psychoJS.experiment.getJSON();获取数据。注意：js code 需要将实验全部转化为 js + html 后再游览器里运行。\n最后，运行实验 (注意，我运行的 html 的实验程序而不是 python 代码)就可以上传数据了。\n额外阅读：发布实验 把编写好的实验文件发布到网上,以便参与者可以访问。发布实验的方式很多,但我这里推荐使用GitHub Pages 或者 Gitee Pages (就像我提供的那个仓库一样),因为它完全免费,使用非常方便。\n首先,在GitHub上创建一个新的仓库。在仓库的设置页面,打开GitHub Pages功能,选择从main分支部署。这样就可以通过https://[your username].github.io/[your repository name]来访问你的实验页面了。最后,将你的实验文件上传到仓库中,这样参与者就可以访问了。\n如果你的HTML文件不是index.html,那么需要在URL后面加上HTML文件名,比如https://[your username].github.io/[your repository name]/experiment.html。\n如果使用的是 psychopy 也可以通过 pavlovia.org 来进行线上实验的部署。\n额外阅读：配置实验 在控制面板上,你可以启用DataPipe的一些高级功能:\n条件分配:可以向DataPipe请求下一个条件编号,用于在多条件实验中指派参与者到不同的条件中。\n数据验证:在将数据发往OSF之前,先检查数据的格式是否正确。这可以避免误传或恶意传输错误数据。\n会话上限:限制每次实验收集的数据条数上限,也是为了避免误传或恶意传输大量无效数据。\n建议根据实验需要谨慎启用这些功能。\n参考资料

However, clinical practice of such models remains a challenge, with poor generalizability being a major limitation. Methods Here, we conducted a pre-registered meta-research assessment on neuroimaging-based models in the psychiatric literature, quantitatively examining global and regional sampling issues over recent decades, from a view that has been relatively underexplored. A total of 476 studies (n = 118,137) were included in the current assessment. Based on these findings, we built a comprehensive 5-star rating system to quantitatively evaluate the quality of existing machine learning models for psychiatric diagnoses. Results A global sampling inequality in these models was revealed quantitatively (sampling Gini coefficient (G) = 0.81, p \u003c .01), varying across different countries (regions) (e.g., China, G = 0.47; the USA, G = 0.58; Germany, G = 0.78; the UK, G = 0.87). Furthermore, the severity of this sampling inequality was significantly predicted by national economic levels (beta= -2.75, p \u003c .001, R2adj = 0.40; r = -.84, 95% CI -.41 to -.97), and was plausibly predictable for model performance, with higher sampling inequality for reporting higher classification accuracy. Further analyses showed that lack of independent testing (84.24% of models, 95% CI 81.0-87.5%), improper cross-validation (51.68% of models, 95% CI 47.2-56.2%), and poor technical transparency (87.8% of models, 95% CI 84.9-90.8%)/availability (80.88% of models, 95% CI 77.3-84.4%) are prevailing in current diagnostic classifiers despite improvements over time. Relating to these observations, model performances were found decreased in studies with independent cross-country sampling validations (all p \u003c .001, BF10 \u003e 15). In light of this, we proposed a purpose-built quantitative assessment checklist, which demonstrated that the overall ratings of these models increased by publication year but were negatively associated with model performance. Conclusions Together, improving sampling economic equality and hence the quality of machine learning models may be a crucial facet to plausibly translating neuroimaging-based diagnostic classifiers into clinical practice.","tags":[],"title":"Sampling inequalities affect generalization of neuroimaging-based diagnostic classifiers in psychiatry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuan-Peng, H","Kaiping Peng","Jie Sui"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\rClick the Preprint button below abstract to check all other Preprint in the website.\r","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"9dc1340d66c0b3c6ca926a0845d3e603","permalink":"https://chuan-peng-lab.netlify.app/zh/publication/2023_preprint_hu2/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/2023_preprint_hu2/","section":"publication","summary":"Evidence for the prioritization of moral information in cognitive processes is mixed.","tags":[],"title":"Self-referencing prioritizes moral character on perceptual matching","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Modelling","Methods"],"content":"本文将介绍两种在 windows 平台下安装 HDDM(0.9.8) 的方法。\n主要通过 wsl2 安装 docker 或者 linux 环境 然后再在 docker 或者 linux 环境下安装 HDDM 通过 docker 部署 HDDM 首先，安装 docker\n下载 docker，有 600M Docker: Accelerated, Containerized Application Development\n注意：Windows 10 版本 2004 或更高版本才能使用 wsl2。 可以在命令行中使用 winver 查看版本号。 如果版本低于 2004，请不要勾选 wsl2，此时可以使用 Hyper-V 来运行 docker 环境。 如果不存在 wsl2，可以参考该安装方法 官方文档。 由于只能装 C 盘，所以直接点 “ok” 就开始安装了。 大概安装 2-3分钟\n如果提醒 “log out”，就需要注销电脑，请注意。 注销或重启后，点击\u0026#34;接受\u0026#34;协议即可。 docker 设置 + 安装 HDDM 在设置-\u0026gt;安装后选择启用WSL2引擎 正式安装 HDDM 之后就可以在wsl命令行中使用docker了。 找到 HDDM docker 可直接点解 pull 也可以运行命令 docker pull hcp4715/hddm -o /path/to/my/images 其中，-o 可以设置储存的相对位置 docker 启动 HDDM 镜像 # windows docker run -it --rm --cpus=4 -v /d/hcp4715/hddm_docker:/home/jovyan/work -p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm jupyter notebook # Ubantu docker run -it --rm --cpus=4 \\ -v /home/hcp4715/hddm_docker:/home/jovyan/work \\ -p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm:0.8 jupyter notebook 也可以通过界面操作启动 新建一个 notebook 导入 hddm 进行测试 通过 Ubuntu-18.04 部署 HDDM 以 windows 系统下，使用 wsl2 + ubuntu 系统安装 hddm 为例。\n首先确保系统已经安装 Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) ，具体安装方法可以参考 官方文档。\nwsl --install -d Ubuntu-18.04 注意，此时可能需要设置linux系统账号和密码。 注意，输入密码时并不会显示，请输入完成后直接点击回车。 (可选)：由于 linux 子系统默认安装在 c 盘。因此，可以将起移动到其他磁盘中。\n# 导出子系统 wsl --export Ubuntu-18.04 D:\\\\docker\\\\wsl-Ubuntu-18.04.tar # 关闭子系统 wsl --shutdown # 注销(删除)子系统 wsl --unregister Ubuntu-18.04 # 导入系统文件到其他磁盘 wsl --import Ubuntu-18.04 d:\\\\docker\\\\wsl2_ubuntu1804 d:\\\\docker\\\\wsl-Ubuntu-18.04.tar --version 2 # 注意，第一个路径为新的安装路径，第二路径为导出的系统文件，--version 2 表明了后端为 wsl2。 # 启动系统 wsl -d Ubuntu-18.04 安装依赖 由于 HDDM ，包括起依赖 pymc, ssms 需要进行编译。因此我们需要提前配置好环境，包括 GCC、Gfortran。\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt install gcc sudo apt install gfortran sudo apt install build-essential 安装 Miniconda 之后，我们需要安装 python 环境，最好的方式是通过 conda 进行 Python 环境的配置\n# 下载 miniconda wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh # 可自行去官网选择其他版本，比如 \u0026lt;https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh\u0026gt;

Authors can either posit their data on an open repository or leave a statement “Data is available upon (reasonable) request”. Recently, a few papers checked whether “Data is available upon request”. A recent preprint in social psychology, among other published studies, depicted a quit bleak picture that “Data is not available upon request” (Gabelica et al., 2022; Hussey, 2023; Tedersoo et al., 2021).\rTo add some anecdote data to the topic about “Data available upon request” statement, we also share our experience in request data here.\nBackground\rI am involved in two ongoing and interconnected projects. The first project focuses on conducting a meta-analysis of articles that have employed the Self-perceptual matching task (SPMT) paradigm. The second project aims to assess the reliability of the SPMT paradigm by reanalyzing research data in published studies. To strengthen the persuasiveness of our findings, the second project requires us to search for publicly available data within the database established from the first project (see our preregistration: https://osf.io/zv628).\nMore datasets are available after 2018\rOur meta-analysis database covers a total of 136 articles citing Sui et al. (2012) from 2013 to 2021 (it should be noted that articles from 2021 may not be included in the database). Among these 136 articles, only 27 claim to have publicly available data. Within these 27 articles, 21 directly provide original data through links in their papers. However, out of these 21 articles, one of them includes an OSF address in their paper, yet it does not contain any data. Furthermore, the remaining 6 articles mention that “Data is available upon request.”\nFigure 1. Number of Paper with or without open data\rMore open data than “upon request”\rIn our reliability project, we selected articles that are only slightly deviated from the original paradigm. That said, we need to get access to data from 14 articles (see our preregistration for details).\rAmong these articles, 9 of them provided links in papers. One of the nine links was empty. We reached out to authors via email, so far, no changes on OSF page.\rThe remaining 5 articles stated that “Data is available upon request”.\nFigure 2. Data is already public or upon request\r60% of data are available upon request\rFor those 5 papers, we sent emails and received responses from each author. Among them, three authors (60%) directly provided trial-level data, allowing us to use this data for our purpose. Additionally, two authors provided average values of participants under different experimental conditions.\rIn a sense, all the articles claiming ‘Data is available upon request’ have provided us with data, though not all data are useful for our purpose.\nFigure 3. Feedback Data After Request\rOverall, the process of requesting data from original authors was relatively smooth, with the majority of authors responding promptly and being willing to share their data. Although two authors provided only individuals’ summary data due to various reasons, these data might be of use for meta-analysis.\rIn our experience, most of authors have a positive attitude towards data sharing and are willing to respond to our requests. However, not all trial-level data are available, as some authors may encounter technical issues or lack of time.\nAs an early career researcher who request data for the first time, I have learned three lessons. (1), write the emails well. I refer the article published in Science (Gruber et al., 2020) on how to write emails. (2), provide as much information about why you need the data as possible. In our case, our protocol and code are already open on GitHub (https://github.com/Chuan-Peng-Lab/ReliabilitySPE), and we included it in all our emails. (3), update the authors’ email through searching. As mentioned by Hussey (2023) in their article, the email addresses provided in many papers may be incorrect and unable to reach the authors. We searched for authors’ information on Google Scholar and found their latest publications and obtain their currently used email address.\nReference\rGabelica, M., et al. (2022).

I used it to decompose the reaction time and accuracy data in my recent manuscript: Good Me Bad Me: Does Valence Influence Self-Prioritization During Perceptual Decision-Making.\nHere are a few tips on how to install and use HDDM, in case that you plan to replicate my analyses using the code and data I share here on Github.\nThe targeted reader of this post are Windows users. (I assume that for most Linux users, you, in the most cases, can figure out how to install and use this package, at least with the help from the online forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hddm-users)).\nMy system information: Win 10 pro, 64 bit, 16 GB RAM\nStep 1: prepare the python environment: 1.1. Download and install Anaconda 3.6 or 3.7 from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.\n1.2. Create virtue python 3.5 environment.\nTo do that, you need first run the Anaconda Prompt, which will be available after you installed Anaconda, as administrator, then run the following code:\nconda create -vv -n py35 python=3.5 jupyter # py35 is the name of the environment, which can be arbitrary 1.3. Activate the py35 env. :\n# To activate this environment, use:\rconda activate py35\r# To deactivate an active environment, use:\rconda deactivate\rStep 2: install HDDM Now you have a python 3.5 environment, you can then install the HDDM package. Of course, you need to activate the py35 environment first. Then:\n2.1. Install HDDM by following code:\nconda install -c pymc hddm # (or conda install -c pymc python=3.5 hddm )\r-proceed?: y\r2.2. Update kabuki, which is crucial package that HDDM depends on, to 0.6.2, otherwise models can not be saved). You can check the version of kabuki to make sure you do have installed 0.6.2\npip install -U --no-deps kabuki --ignore-installed\rconda list # check the version of kabuki Step 3: use HDDM Now, we almost ready. A final step is to use an appropriate editor for editing and running the scripts. I used both jupyter lab (an updated version of jupyter notebook, but you can use jupyter notebook) and spyder. The script files of the former ends with “.ipynb”, the script files of the later one end with “.py”\nTo use jupyter lab, if you like, you need to install jupyter lab in your py35 env. As follows:\nconda install jupyter lab\rAfter that, changing the working directory of anaconda prompt to the folder where you stored the scripts and data, and type jupyter lab to open run jupyter lab. Note the (weird) way to change directory in windows system.\ncd /d c:\\goodme\\2_pilot_study\\Results\\4_hddm\\ # in windows you have to add /d to change the directory\r# run in jupyter lab or jupyter note book, for stim-based modelling\rjupyter lab #(or jupyter notebook if you use jupyter notebook)\rSimilarly, to run in spyder, you need to install spyder in this py35 env. conda install spyder\rThen, type spyder to activate spyder\nspyder # you will need to change the working directory in the script.\rFinal note: I know that there exists the curse of knowledge, which means that I may assume you know what I know but you don’t. So please free feel to post comment or shout out on twitter (@hcp4715) to let me know if you encountered any problem when reproducing my analyses.\n","date":1556475207,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556475207,"objectID":"e6be80305418a176029090bf59dc8e56","permalink":"https://chuan-peng-lab.netlify.app/zh/post/2019-04-29-how-to-install-and-use-hddm/","publishdate":"2019-04-29T02:13:27+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/post/2019-04-29-how-to-install-and-use-hddm/","section":"post","summary":"Feburary 14, 2021 update: Please note that this blog post was outdated because of the updates of Anaconda/miniconda.\nAugust 2020 update: I’ve created a HDDM docker image, which can be easily installed and used after installing docker.","tags":["DDM","perceptual decision-making","python"],"title":"How to install and use HDDM","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zickfeld, JH","Schubert, TW","Seibt, B","...
