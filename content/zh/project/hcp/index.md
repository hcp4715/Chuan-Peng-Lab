I am a faculty member of the School of Psychology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China. My research interests include social cognition (i.e., how human process self- and other-related information), SES/poverty, and reproducibility. I value open, transparency, and reproducibility in research, initiated the Chinese Open Science Network, a grassroots network for promoting awareness of reproducibility and open science using Chinese. I am an assistant director of Psychological Science Accelerator, a distributed laboratory network.  

In my free time, I loves outdoor sports, e.g., rock climbing, mountaineering, and hiking.
